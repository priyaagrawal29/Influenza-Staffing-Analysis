# Influenza Staffing Analysis
## Project Summary
This project involves an in-depth analysis of population data, influenza deaths data, and influenza visits data for a medical staffing agency to plan for the upcoming influenza season. The objective of the analysis is to generate a staffing plan for the distribution of temporary medical staff to hospitals and clinics across all US states in preparation for the upcoming influenza season. The analysis also aims to inform the timing for the distribution of medical staff and determine which states require more staff than others. The analysis was conducted in Excel and visualizations were generated in Tableau. The insights derived from the visualizations will help the medical staffing agency to allocate the appropriate amount of temporary medical staff to each state at the appropriate times of the year which will ensure that there are adequate medical staff available to treat the increased number of patients during the influenza season.
## Key Goals
- Provide information to support a staffing plan, detailing what data can help inform the timing and spatial distribution of medical personnel throughout the United States.
- Determine whether influenza occurs seasonally or throughout the entire year. If seasonal, does it start and end at the same time (month) in every state?
- Prioritize states with large vulnerable populations. Consider categorizing each state as low-, medium-, or high-need based on its vulnerable population count.
- Assess data limitations that may prevent you from conducting your desired analyses.
## Data
Data sets used for this project:
- Influenza deaths by geography from CDC
- Population data by geography, time, age, and gender by US Census Bureau
- Influenza visits data from CDC (Fluview)
## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel: To clean and analyze data.
- Tableau Public: To generate visualizations.
